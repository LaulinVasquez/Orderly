## Overview

**Project Title**: Orderly - Order & Customer Management System

**Project Description**: Orderly is aPython-based application that allows users to manage customers and their orders using a simple GUI built with Tkinter. It connects to a SQLite3 database and supports functionality like adding,editing and deleting (CRUD) and other functions.

**Project Goals**:
1. Build a clena, user-friendly interface for managing customer and order data
2. Store data persistently using a local SQLite3 database
3. improve CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) skills with database
## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed
3. Run the GUI app using: python gui.py

Instructions for using the software:

1. Launch the app — the main menu will display options like Add Customer, Add Order, View Orders, etc.
2. Use the forms to add new customers and their orders.
3. Use the table views to see all data and keep it organized
4. Use the "Edit Customer Order" or "Change Order Status" options for modifications.
